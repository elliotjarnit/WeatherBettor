# TO DO
# Grab NWS forecasted highs from LAX, Denver, etc.
# Grab available bets for areas on Kalshi
# Make bets +/- 1 degree from forecasted high.
# Available bets are usually a range of 1, so maybe bet on the averaged range closest to forecasted high?
# Maybe spread, either over multiple temps or multiple locations
# Analyze high periodically. If it changes, change bet.
# Keep a log of success rates
